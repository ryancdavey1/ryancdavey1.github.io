**A need to execute and build on designs.**

Growing up, I always appreciated intuitive user interfaces that accompanied electronic devices . It became a game for me to explore desktop computers, music players, and mobile apps efficiently. How can I edit this home movie? How can I find my latest songs to play on the computer and sync with my MP3? What do search results look like on the latest smartphone?

**In the back of my mind, I was intruigued by the thought of designing something that could make interactions with it feel more effortless, and captivating.**

Fast foward to the summer following my sophomore year of college. I had previously taken introductory classes in C and OCaml, but now a course in Swift  and internship would make me apppreciate **the intersection of design and coding**. Here, I was challenged to understand the details behind app development as I recreated class examples. Here, I realized how much effort goes into the execution of user interfaces, based on well thought out design mockups.

I would later use this experience in an engineering design class, creating a functional app in a team of six, **taking a concept from the drawing board to a final product.** A subsequent course in Javascript, making use of the D3 library, reinforced the importance of design when building data visualizations, and how to make sure the information being presented has an impact

It is in my continued study and practice of software engineering that I hope to build off of the design of simple apps and  visualizations to websites, creating programs that are powerful enough to provide value beyond the initial sketches and implementations I have made.
