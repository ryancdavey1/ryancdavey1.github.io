The majority of my time after completing the Flatiron bootcamp has been dedicated to career work - writing emails, resumes, cover letters, and making LinkedIn edits. However, there are some coding concepts that I am looking to explore a bit more:

* Node.js - I do have experience creating automated scripts with this framework, and I will be looking more deeply into the performance of Node and its further capabilities for testing.
* Python - I did learn Python during college, and wrote Python code for my senior thesis. Specifically, after I revisit the basics, I would like to look at the Cirq library, which focuses on quantum computing, and was the subject of my thesis.
* Revisiting projects - I really enjoyed working on the projects I created during Flatiron, and I will spend time thinking about what features to add to each.
