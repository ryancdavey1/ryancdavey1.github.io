## Intro
10 Months on from starting the Flatiron Software Engineering bootcamp, there have been countless lessons, tips, and tricks, learned throughout the process of coding 5 projects. Here are a few that stand out to me, because they feel applicable across all 5 modules.

## One: Fail fast, fail often
I had learned some JavaScript, Node.js, and Python before the Flatiron Bootcamp, but Ruby, Rails, and Sinatra felt completely new. I had learned a bit of React prior as well, but it felt as though I was starting over entirely because some of the topics still seemed complex the second time through. This meant that some labs and coding challenges in office hours required multiple attempls for me to complete at first. But as the bootcamp carried on, I felt more comfortable with my initial solutions to the problems given in the modules, and more comfortable taking the first steps to get my projects up and running. This level of comfortability can only be achieved by recognizing that failure initially is part of the process, and your skills at architecting software solutions will become more refined with each module.

## Two: Take big or small steps, but take steps every day
The weekly schedule for the labs to complete was a huge help during the bootcamp. The recommendations aided me in staying on track, but what I also felt was important was the flexibility on *when* during the week I could complete them. For example, if there were 20 labs to complete for the week, on average, I should be doing 4 labs per day (only including week days), but work and other daily events don't always allow for 4 labs to completed every day. This would mean some labs needed to be completed on the weekends. However, instead of dwelling on the fact that I might not be completing 4 labs on a given day, I focused on just *completing as many labs as time would resonably allow*, so that I could look back on the week with optimism, knowing at the very least I had made some progress towards the goal of completing the bootcamp.

The same mindset applied to the projects - even if my code commit was small, I knew that I had made some small step that would take me even closer to a big step in the future. I just had to wait for my perseverance with bug fixes and feature additions to pay off. 

## Three: Write each project plan in pencil
At the beginning of each project, I wrote down all of the functionality I wanted my project to have, and the process through which I wanted to complete everything. Many edits and code commits later, I knew that the checklist I made wasn't as straightforward as I initially thought. To deal with this, my plans were physically written with pencil - each database schema, wireframe, or feature list could be altered or scribbled on. But more important was the mental aspect - the plan in my mind was also written in pencil. Knowing that I would possibly need to return to the drawing board with each bug I found kept me on my toes, making me adapt the features of the project to deal with new scenarios. Writing in pen would have been disadvantageous to the project, making my project idea too rigid to ultimately succeed. 

## Conclusion: Use the most recent accomplishment as incentive
Every time I completed a module, I was satisfied knowing that I was getting closer to completing the bootcamp after learning another coding language/framework. My mindset upon completing the bootcamp is the same as the beginning: I am always looking forward to the next challenge after every major milestone. Given that I am now at the end, I am extremely excited to find an invigorating software engineering position, and build upon my coding skills, whether it be in Javascript, React, Node.js, Ruby, Rails, Python, or some other language.
